            <h1>Open the console</h1>
            <p> Visual Studio Code is a platform where you can create amazing websites and webpages. In coding class, We are learning about the console.
                When you are coding, have you ever seen messages pop up in a small box in the corner, informing you if there is an error? This box is called
                the Console. In this project, I have written some messages in the same and to open the console, you can simply
                right click and click on the option INSPECT. Go to the option console in INSPECT, and see the messages I have written!
